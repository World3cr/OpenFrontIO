# OpenFrontIO Desktop Client - Setup Complete! 🎮

## ✅ Problem Solved: Port Mismatch Fixed

**The Issue**: Electron desktop client was trying to load from `http://localhost:8080`, but the webpack dev server runs on `http://localhost:9000`.

**The Fix**: Updated `electron-main.cjs` to use the correct port (9000) throughout the application.

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### Updated Files:

- `electron-main.cjs` - Fixed all port references from 8080 → 9000
- Created `TEST-ELECTRON-PORT.bat` - Simple test script for the fix

### Port Changes Made:

1. **Main URL loading**: `http://localhost:8080` → `http://localhost:9000`
2. **Error page references**: Updated all error messages to mention port 9000
3. **Navigation validation**: Updated origin checking for port 9000
4. **Console logging**: Updated log messages to show correct port

## 🚀 How to Test the Fix

### Option 1: Quick Test (Recommended)

```bash
# Run this new test script
.\TEST-ELECTRON-PORT.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Test

```bash
# Step 1: Start dev server
npm run dev

# Step 2: Wait for "Client and server started successfully" message

# Step 3: In a new terminal, start Electron
npm run electron
```

### Option 3: Complete Auto-Start

```bash
# This starts everything automatically
.\COMPLETE-START.bat
```

## 🎯 What Should Happen Now

1. **Development server starts** on `http://localhost:9000` ✅
2. **Electron desktop client** loads from `http://localhost:9000` ✅
3. **Game interface appears** in the desktop window (no more blank screen!) ✅
4. **All functionality works** the same as in the browser ✅

## 🎮 Desktop Client Features

- **Native desktop window** with proper menus
- **Keyboard shortcuts** (F11 fullscreen, F12 dev tools, Ctrl+R reload)
- **Game-specific menu items** (New Game, Join Public Game)
- **Error handling** with helpful messages if server isn't running
- **Auto-retry** functionality built into error pages

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Electron still shows a blank/white screen:

1. Check that the dev server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Verify it says "Client and server started successfully"
3. Open browser to `http://localhost:9000` to verify it works
4. Then start Electron: `npm run electron`

### If you see the error page in Electron:

- This means the server isn't running on port 9000
- Start the server first: `npm run dev`
- Click "Retry Connection" in the error page

### If port 9000 is already in use:

- Check what's using port 9000: `netstat -ano | findstr :9000`
- Stop other processes or use a different port in `webpack.config.js`

## 🎉 Success!

The OpenFrontIO desktop client should now work perfectly! You can:

- Play the game in a native desktop window
- Use keyboard shortcuts for better gaming experience
- Enjoy the same game functionality as the web version
